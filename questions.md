Question 1) 

The information ratio (IR) is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns.

        IR = (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return) / Tracking Error

where:

    - IR=Information ratio
    
    - Portfolio Return=Portfolio return for period
    
    - Benchmark Return=Return on fund used as benchmark
    
    - Tracking Error=Standard deviation of difference between portfolio and benchmark returnsâ€‹
    
Why does then our covariance still contain the "market", as represented usually by the first PCA component? Should we subtract it?

Question 2)

Following Quedtion 1): in context of the LeeLam RiskBudgeting, the pairwise bets bet on the relative performance of 2 assets, and then by construction the 
market part of their performance is netted off. One reason more for getting rid of the market component from the cov. from the asset or from the bet cov?
