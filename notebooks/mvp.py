"""
Working with denoised and detoned covariance matrices renders substantial
benefits. Those benefits result from the mathematical properties of those treated
matrices, and can be evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments

Code computes the true minimum variance portfolio, derived from the true covariance matrix.
Using those allocations as benchmark, it then computes the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) across all weights, with and
without denoising.

the denoised minimum variance portfolio incurs only 40.15% of the RMSE incurred by the minimum variance portfolio without
denoising. That is a 59.85% reduction in RMSE from denoising alone
